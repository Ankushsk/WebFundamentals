# Platform Health in Chrome 61 {: .page-title }

{% include "web/_shared/contributors/josephmedley.html" %}

## What is platform health?

The items listed here may change before Chrome 61 reaches stable. For this reason they are only described in brief. If documentation already exists on MDN, I will link to it. Otherwise, I'll link to the spec. 

## Spec conformance

For Chrome 61 we made the following imporovements to better conform with changes to W3C and WHATWG specs.

### Animation

`Animation` objects can now be created with a [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor).
